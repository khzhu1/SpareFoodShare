Milk,Arla B.O.B gives you the best of both worlds. A fat free skimmed milk that's as tasty as semi-skimmed; so you can enjoy delicious milk without having to compromise. Fat free & full of taste - perfect for cereal; tea; coffee or even on its own instead of your usual skimmed milk or semi skimmed milk.
